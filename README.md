# quick_sort_parallel
Parallelized Version of Quick_Sort. Made into a separate Repo for my class.

The purpose of this project is to provide an example of a quicksort on a large array in parallel.
This project is a foil to the serial quicksort that I have, which is also on GitHub.

By Ryder Dale Walton Solves the 4th Programming Assignment for Parallel Programming (Challenge) as it was added by Dr. Patton.

The solution works. There is not human input required, so it is not prone operator input error. I don't expect runtime problems.

I tested in a Windows 10 environment using CLion, Cygwin, and C11.
